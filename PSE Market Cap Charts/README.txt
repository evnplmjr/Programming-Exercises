## Details
   This exercise is focused on using Pandas for data organization, and Matplotlib for data visualization. 
   It is also inclined with my interest in finance. The results show how the various companies
   and sectors within the Philippine Stock Exchange are valued by their respective market capitalizations, 
   and would give the viewer an idea how stock investors and traders value these companies.

## Insights
   I developed a better familiarity with Matplotlib and Pandas in this exercise. I aim to continuously
   develop this output as I continue to learn more.
