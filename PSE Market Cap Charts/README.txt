   ## Exercise Info:
   
      This exercise is focused on using Pandas for data organization, and Matplotlib for data visualization. 
      It is also inclined with my interest in finance. The results show how the various companies
      and sectors within the Philippine Stock Exchange are valued by their respective market capitalizations, 
      and would give the viewer an idea how stock investors and traders value these companies.
