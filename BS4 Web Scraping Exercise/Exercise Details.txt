  Description
  This web scraping exercise uses the BeautifulSoup package to gather information from a blog.
  This exercise was done to showcase and develop my ability in web scraping using the BeautifulSoup 
  package. In this exercise, the blog contained titles of educational articles, books and also 
  included links of online learning resources. The expected output for this exercise was to 
  scrape the blog for the educational resources and to create a CSV/spreadsheet copy for myself.
  
  Lessons Learned
  In this exercise, I realized that an investigative approach is necessary in web scraping.
  I learned how to structure my code, so that the scraped data does not become to difficult 
  for me in the post-process. I am also made aware of the limitations of the BeautifulSoup
  package and I appreciate it for its simplicity and ease.
